        <hr>
        <p>Imagine this scenario, you are a responsible full-time employee and working has taken up a big portion of your everyday life. At home, you have an elderly mother you have to look after and take
          good care of. You are busy from eight a.m. to five p.m. daily and could not take good care of your dear mother. You decide to take her to the care center for professional care.</p>

<p>During work, you grew concerned about how your she is doing. You could pay a visit, but itâ€™s hard to fit into your busy schedule without significant effort of canceling and rescheduling.
Nowadays, as people gets busier, they might not have time to take care of their lovedones full time or does not have the equipment for it, hence, there is a need to connect their loved-ones with them.</p>

<p>Our team researched into the current applications to see if there are solutions to this problem. Our result came back negative, although we have found a lot of applications that provide services to a
  particular aspect of caring really well, but none of them connect the family members with their loved ones that in the care center. Following table shows different aspect of what the client wishes to do with their
  loved ones in the care center and the corresponding app that accomplishes it.</p>
