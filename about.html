        <h2>About CareConnect</h2>
        <p>Imagine this scenario: you are a responsible full-time employee and working has taken up a big portion of your everyday life. At home, you have an elderly mother you have to look after and take
          good care of. You are busy during normal business hours and can not take good care of your dear mother. You decide to take her to the care center for professional care.</p>

<p>During work, you grow concerned about how your mother is doing. You could pay a visit, but itâ€™s hard to fit it into your busy schedule.
Nowadays, as people get busier, they might not have time to take care of their loved ones full time and also do not have the equipment for it. Hence, there is a need to connect their loved-ones with them.</p>

<p>Our team researched into the current applications to see if there are solutions to this problem. Our results came back negative. Although we have found a lot of applications that provide services to a
  particular aspect of caring (e.g. logistics, medicine, etc..), none of them provide emotional care to the elderly from their loved ones. Thus, we have created CareConnect in order to service this need and help make families closer.</p>
